- 👋 Hi, I’m @mo-j-loaf but i go by "Loafy"...
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Linux && getting into a better Life Routine. (lol) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux terminal commands and GUI/Terminal customization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... well nothing I guess because I'm a N00b and am still trying to grasp the basics. (lol)
- 📫 How to reach me ... Um, mo.j.loaf@gmail.com I guess... I don't really do social networking, but thinking about Mastodon lately. We'll see I guess...
